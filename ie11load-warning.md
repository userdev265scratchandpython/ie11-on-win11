using internet explorer in a virtualized environement is advised if you still want to use ie11
ie11 might still have issues such as things not showing up, if this is the case, please add it to the issues tab
if you can, avoid going on unknown websites, and if you also can, only use IE11 for local HTML files that are safe.

you could get malware since ie11 has not gotten all thr latest patches
websites that require newer browsers will have issues
html5 is not included in IE11, most securiy patches and most features might be missing

Q : "is it for any vertion of windows"?

A : it works by showing back the elements from IE11 that are hidden by default on latest windows vertions.

buttons all look straight from windows ME                                                                                                                                         (cannot be fixed - comes from IE11 itself)

there is no accent color and so on by default, IE11 uses white                                                                            (won't fix - no known way to use ms VBScript to set ie's default accent color yet)

cannot set as default browser                                                                            (won't fix - compiling would give it an "EXE" exention but not allow passing to ie11 from batch trough ms VBScript)

-fixed-

NONE
