# ie11
Discover the 'hidden' IE11 on Windows 11. Microsoft didn't remove it, they just... hid it. This script reveals the 'lost' browser, making it functional again. Available in batch and PowerShell. Warning: IE11 lacks most security patches, making it vulnerable to attacks. Use with caution and avoid running on actual hardware. using virtual machines is recommended. for ie11-dedicated pages, the chromium-based edge has an IE mode, it will keep edge looking like itself but allow ie-dedicated pages to work
