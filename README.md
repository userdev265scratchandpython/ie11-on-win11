# ie11-on-win11
Discover the 'hidden' IE11 on Windows 11. Microsoft didn't remove it, they just... hid it. This script reveals the 'lost' browser, making it functional again. Available in batch and PowerShell. Warning: IE11 lacks most security patches, making it vulnerable to attacks. Use with caution and avoid running on actual hardware.
